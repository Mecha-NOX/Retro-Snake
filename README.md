*Classic Arcade Gameplay | Developed in Raylib C++*

---

## **Overview**

*Snake* is a modern reimagining of the classic arcade game. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food, navigating through obstacles and trying to avoid collisions. Developed using C++ and Raylib, this project demonstrates my ability to implement core gameplay mechanics, manage game state, and design simple yet engaging gameplay.

## **Features**

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**
A faithful recreation of the classic Snake game, where the player controls the snake, eats food, and avoids hitting walls or itself.

- **Collision Detection**
Real-time detection of collisions between the snake and the game boundaries or itself, which ends the game when triggered.

- **Score Tracking**
Players earn points for each food item consumed, with the score displayed on the screen.

- **Basic Animation**
Smooth, animated movement of the snake and food items for an engaging gameplay experience.

- **Responsive Controls**
Simple keyboard controls for directing the snake in four directions.
